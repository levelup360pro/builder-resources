# LevelUp360 Builder Resources

## Overview
Welcome to the LevelUp360 Builder Resources repository! This is your one-stop hub for free, practical tools and resources I've developed as part of my hands-on work as an AI Solutions Architect. Focused on bridging theoretical knowledge to real-world enterprise implementation, these resources emphasize secure, scalable Azure infrastructure with an eye toward AI governance and cloud architecture. Everything here is a byproduct of my designs and builds, and is shared under an MIT license to help aspiring and experienced technical professionals level up their skills.

Whether you're a junior engineer translating small-scale projects to enterprise demands, a transitioning IT pro pivoting to cloud/AI, or a seasoned architect optimizing for security and cost, these tools are designed to save you time and demonstrate implementation mastery. For more guided learning, download my FREE "AI Solutions Architect's Blueprint" at [https://levelup360.pro/ai-sa-blueprint/](https://levelup360.pro/ai-sa-blueprint/) or explore my mentorship programs.

This repo is for sharing resources only—no contributions or pull requests are accepted. If you find these useful, star the repo, fork it for personal use, or connect with me on LinkedIn for discussions.

## Available Resources
Below is a curated list of free resources, organized by sub-folder. Each includes a brief description and direct link. I'll add more as I build and share from my projects.

| **Azure Diag Policy Builder** | A Python script to automate customization of 148+ Azure diagnostic policies, adding parameters for dedicated tables, metrics, and categories. Solves enterprise logging gaps efficiently. | [/scripts/policy-builder](/scripts/azure-diag-policy-builder) |
| **Azure AI Foundry LLM Security Testing Framework** | A Python-based framework tests the security of Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed via Azure AI Foundry. It runs 12 specific tests to check if the AI can be tricked into dangerous behaviors like executing commands or generating malicious code. The tool analyzes responses, detects risks, and generates detailed reports. | [/scripts/ai-foundry-security-testing](/scripts/ai-foundry-security-testing) |
